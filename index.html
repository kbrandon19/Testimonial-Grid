        <p class="relative z-10 mt-4 font-bold text-xl leading-tight">I received a job offer mid-course, and the
          subjects
          I learned were
          current, if not more so,
          in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>

        <p class=" relative z-10 mt-4 opacity-70 text-sm"> “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
          I’ve been looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
          course
          and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
          successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

          recommended!</p>

        <p class=" relative z-10 mt-4 opacity-70 text-sm"> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
          code. I needed some structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
          of
          theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
          disappoint.
          They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
          was
          outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land
          a
          job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
