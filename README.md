## My process

### Built with


- Tailwind CSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I decided to try my hand at completing this task using Tailwind CSS. The concept is quite easy and straight forward when it come to adding the styling with only classes. Having the documentation next to me I was able to create it as close to the design as possible.


### Continued development

There are a ton of things I still have left to learn within Tailwind CSS but overall I am happy with the outcome and I plan on using Tailwind CSS for future projects.
