## My process
After viewing the static design for the website I knew it would be a perfect opportunity to use Tailwind CSS. Due to the scope of the project is chose to use Tailwind via CDN. In future projects I will include Tailwind as part of my build process to customize the theme and use the directives. There are a ton of things I still have left to learn within Tailwind CSS but overall I am happy with the outcome and I plan on using Tailwind CSS for future projects to become more proficient.

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me become more familiar with the naming conventions of each styling class within Tailwind CSS.
